          Mindfulness meditation originates from Buddhist teachings and is the
          most popular and researched form of meditation in the West. In
          mindfulness meditation, you pay attention to your thoughts as they
          pass through your mind. You don’t judge the thoughts or become
          involved with them. You simply observe and take note of any patterns.
          This type of meditation is good for people who don’t have a teacher to
          guide them, as it can be easily practiced alone.

          teacher to guide them, as it can be easily practiced alone.

          with your environment. This allows you to experience deeper levels of
          awareness.
