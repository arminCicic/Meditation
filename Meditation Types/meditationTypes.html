            Mindfulness meditation is the practice of actually being present in the moment, which in turn trains us to become more
            mindful throughout the day, particularly during difficult situations. As Ms. Brach puts it: “Mindfulness is your
            awareness of what's going on in the present moment without any judgment.

            The types of spiritual meditation are as diverse as the world’s
            spiritual traditions themselves. Many of the meditation techniques
            listed in this article could be considered spiritual meditation.
            Spiritual meditation can be practiced at home or in a place of
            worship. This practice is beneficial for those who seek spiritual
            growth and a deeper connection to a higher power or spiritual force.

          <div class="meditation-text">
            Focused meditation involves concentration using any of the five
            senses. You can focus on something internal, like your breath, or
            you can bring in external influences to help focus your
            attention.This practice may be simple in theory, but it can be
            difficult for beginners to hold their focus for longer than a few
            minutes at first. If your mind does wander, simply come back to the
            practice and refocus. This type of meditation is good for people who
            don’t have a teacher to guide them, as it can be easily practiced
            alone.

            of meditation where the movement guides you into a deeper connection
            with your body and the present moment. Movement meditation is good

          <div class="meditation-text">
            Mantra meditation is prominent in many teachings, including Hindu
            and Buddhist traditions. This type of meditation uses a repetitive
            sound to clear the mind. It can be a word, phrase, or sound, one of
            the most common being “om.” Your mantra can be spoken loudly or
            quietly. After chanting the mantra for some time, you’ll be more
            alert and in tune with your environment. This allows you to
            experience deeper levels of awareness.

            Also known as body scan meditation, progressive relaxation is a
            practice aimed at reducing tension in the body and promoting
            relaxation. Oftentimes, this form of meditation involves slowly
            tightening and relaxing one muscle group at a time throughout the
            body. In some cases, it may also encourage you to imagine a gentle
            wave flowing through your body to help release any tension. This
            form of meditation is often used to relieve stress and unwind before
            bedtime.

            scenes, images, or figures. This practice involves imagining a scene
            vividly and using all five senses to add as much detail as possible.

            the intention of embodying their qualities.
